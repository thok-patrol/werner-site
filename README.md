Plugins and Structure of default website

This repository is meant to be cloned and started as a new project. The reason for its existance is so that you don't have to go through the process of manually installing react, webpack, express, and all that other technical jazz when you just want to sit down and make a site with a web server.

There are four main commands (npm run-script) that you can use.
  
  FRONT END
  npm run dev //converts the files from the src/ folder and compiles them into a webpack development build in the dev/ folder
  npm run build //converts the files from the src/ folder and compiles them into a webpack production build in the dist/ folder
  
  BACK END
  npm run server //runs the expressjs fileserver in the development environment (port 3000)
  npm run server-prod //runs the expressjs fileserver in the production environment (port 2000)
  
If you have any questions about how this works, I dunno, email me I guess?
